## 📸 Overview


**Face Match App** is a lightweight **Flask** web application that allows users to upload an ID card and a selfie to verify identity.

It works by comparing the two images using the `face_recognition` library, which calculates **128-dimensional face embeddings** and measures the **Euclidean distance** between them to determine a match.

All verification results are stored locally in a **SQLite database** and displayed in a clean, Bootstrap-powered dashboard with filtering options.
